npx to execute when something is not working

add to package.json in scripts, a line you want to be executed each time you call its name,

in production we wont run this, its slower, we will compile on our own.

add git repo:
git remote add origin https://github.com/Yuval1Maman/NodeJs-jb.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

docker:
docker run --name mysql -d -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=1 -e MYSQL_DATABASE=cryptoapp -e MYSQL_TCP_PORT=3306 -p 3310:3306 mysql:latest

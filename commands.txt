nodemon --exec ts-node [file]

npx to execute when something is not working

add to package.json in scripts, a line you want to be executed each time you call its name,
see cryptoApp for more, in there when we call "npm run start" the line works.
in production we wont run this, its slower, we will compile on our own.
